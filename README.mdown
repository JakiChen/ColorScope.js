# colorscope.js

## Restrictions

  * Images located on external domains cannot be translated because rendering their contents taints the `canvas` element, making `toDataURL()` unavailable.

## TODO

  * I'd like to have a go at redoing this as a Chrome plugin. I think this would allow me to get around the various security restrictions.

## Hacking

  1. `npm install uglify-js`
  2. `make`
  3. serve this directory from a local webserver running on port 4000 and hit up `test.htm`.
